## About
The Mental Health Advocacy Project was a project that I created through my college's Phi Theta Kappa organization. This first newsletter was a component of the entire project and was created in order to raise awareness on mental health to campus students, during the pandemic crisis in 2020. This first edition newsletter includes information about mental health, as well as resources from our collaboration with the college's counseling department.
